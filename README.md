Pet entertainment center using Microcontrollers

this is a project that I am doing with my 12 year old daughter.  The idea is to entertain and train pets using technology.  We are using capacitive touch to activate a pan/tilt stage that entertains the cat with a laser pointer.  Also we are planning automated food dispensing and voice commands.  Lets see where things are going.
